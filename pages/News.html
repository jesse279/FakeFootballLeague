        <p class="article_body">The Cougars celebrate a 48 - 30 Victory over the Austin Rangers to
          give them their second Championship in three years. This put the capstone
          on a dominating undeafeated season. Head Couch Mike Wazowski teams FFL
          reporter Waluigi that "I've never been prouder of those boys in my life.
          They've put their hearts and souls into the team and deserve the success
          this team has accomplished." Deserve to win they do, average more than
          35 points per game their offense has been explosive. Their defense also
          let the least amount of point scored during the regular season. We are
          likely seeing the beginning of the Wazowski dynasty.

      <div >
        <p class="article_body">The week 8 matchup between the Columbus Cougars
          and the Salt Lake SeaBirds was highly anticipated. The showdown certainly
          lived up the the anticipation. The SeaBirds took and early lead in the
            first quarter, but a pair of turnovers gave the Cougars the lead going
            into halftime. Salt Lake had a chance to take the lead late in the fourth
            quarter, but elected to go for in on 4th and 1 on the Cougars 30 yardline.
            The Cougar defense made a stand and Senior quarterback Aang led them
            down into field goal range. Deadshot remains perfect on the season by kicking
            a 30-yards field goal to give them the lead as time expires.

          think the Rangers to do as well as they did this Season? After a losing season
          last year, rebounding to the League Championship has been a high mark for
          the program. Led by the powerful running back, Spongebob Squarepants, They
          have seemed unstoppable at times. We can all be sure to watch out for
          these powerhouses in the upcoming season.

      <div >
        <p class="article_body">For a third season in a row the San Diego Trojans
          have had a lack luster performance. A total of three wins in three seasons
          is the worst in the league. The Trojans have become a laughing stock
          in FFL culture and teams consider playing them a bye week. Many expect
          Couch Squidward to be let go in the coming weeks. Of course, with holes
          in both the O-line and the secondary, a change in management won't gaurentee
          immediate change. The Owner mismanagment of funds has left trust for the
          Organization at an all-time low. Experts speculate that it will be difficult
          for them to find a good replacement.

        <p class="article_body">Everyone and their dog was excited to see the Rain Devils
          sweep away the competition led by Couch Katara and their MVP QB
          Sokka the Boomerang. They were the favorite to become the first repeat Champions
          in the history of the FFL. This season has been disaster for them. Sokka was
          injured in the first game and the Rain Devils went 3-3 without him. The small
          glimmer of sunlight at the end of this storm was their final game when
          Sokka was healthy enough to play. A 50-7 scoring fest let everyone see
          what they could have been. Expections for them remain high for next season.
